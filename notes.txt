v-bind:classes -> bind the attributes to buttonClasses 
v-on is eventHandlers 
ohh so there is a slot in vue like in blade template in laravel
@subit.prevent -> prevent the default action
one way od passing a data to parent and child is props

a parent will communicate to the child to passing down props
a child will communicate to the parent to ommit an event 

this.$emit('name', this.newAssignment)
to listen a custom event @add or the name of your ommit @name
Set -> is  a way to create a set of items which set items must be unique
you can also create a :class for it to be active it will merge in the class 

class= "border ...."
:class = "{'border rounded': condition}"


@input = "name = $event.target.value" -> long form of v-model="name"
v model do 2 things it binds the value and it listen when the value changes 
update:modelValue


to setup a fake api npm install json-server --save-dev
npx json-server <db.json> to set it up 


can use v-text or the {{heading}}

<template v-slot:default"> -> this shows what is the default slot is 
$slots -> all of my slots will be stored here
v-if = "$slots.heading" 
#heading -> this is the short hand for v-slots:heading


vite is a tool is a build tool that takes care of server and hot reloading when it changes a file the browser instantly update the change 
    build tool that bundle up the code

npm init vue@latest

.vue is a single style component -> it is a single file that contains a script, respective template and any optional styling
@ is an alias

<RouterView /> -> will display the corresponding vue components for whatever component matches the current route
pascal case is the convention
THe -> is a common convention to proceed it with the word the -> it is a one time thing 

2 diff ways to organized and structure the code 

options api or composition api 

options API is this code that i am doing 

composition is a set of api that allows us to author vue components using imported functions instead of declaring an options 
it is an umbrella that covers the following API

reactivity API -> ref and reactive , that allows us to directly create reactive component state and watchers note like the one that i did in watchng if there is one added in the completed assignment 

Lifecycle Hooks -> onMounted() and unMounted() that allows us to programmatically hook into component lifecycle 

dependency Injection -> provide() and inject() that allows us to leverage VUE dependency injection system while using reactivity api
